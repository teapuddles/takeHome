# 2020 Codecademy Apprenticeship Code Challenge (Frontend Software Engineer)

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!
Thanks for taking the time to work on a frontend takehome assignment.
We really appreciate you applying to work at Codecademy!

This README.md details the prompt for your assignment.
Rest assured, we won't use the code for anything other than as part of your application.

You can see the competencies we'll be grading it on [here](https://github.com/Codecademy/engineering-competencies/blob/master/interviews/frontend-takehome.md). We expect this to take you roughly 2-3 hours. Please let us know if there's anything unclear about it!

For your convenience, we've placed these instructions on [GitHub](https://github.com/Codecademy/internship-code-challenge/tree/master/frontend) and [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/multiple-choice-quiz-intern-frontend-takehome-l93ce).
Please submit using a Codesandbox fork.

## The Situation

Codecademy needs an embeddable `MultipleChoiceQuiz` widget to help learners evaluate their skills.
It should be viewable on both wide ("desktop") and narrow ("mobile") screens.

You're an engineer at Codecademy and tasked with building it.
Hooray! ðŸŽ‰

See `./mockups/*.png` for rough descriptions of what it should look like.

> Don't bother getting your page exactly like our mockups -- just match the general layout.

### What You're Given

Your application code should live in the `src/` directory. We've set it up to work with React, though you're welcome to add other libraries if you need.

In the `src/data/quizzes.js` file, we've exported for you a set of `quizzes`, each of which contains the following data:

- `title`: A human-readable display text title for the quiz

- `questions` An ordered list of questions to be asked, each of which consists of:
  - `text`
  - `correctAnswer`
  - `incorrectAnswers`

### Feature Requirements

Your code will allow the user to take each of those `quizzes` in order.

1. For a current quiz, display its title on top of the page, along with a single questionâ€™s text and randomly ordered answers -- starting with the first question.

2. When a questionâ€™s answer is clicked, it should show:

   - A â€˜Nextâ€™ button at the bottom of the page
   - Either _'Correct!'_ or _'Incorrect...'_ above that button, with the correct answer outlined in green, and the incorrect answer (if any) outlined in red with a ~~strikethrough~~ over its text

3. After all questions have been answered, display a friendly summary screen that lists:

   - How many questions were in the quiz
   - How many of those questions were answered correctly
   - A button to move to the next quiz (or the first quiz, if they just took the last)
   - A random encouragement message _(use `getMessage` from `src/data/messages.js`)_.

4. You must write two unit tests:
   - one for when a user selects the correct answer
   - one for when the user selects the incorrect answer

### Delighters

In addition to the base requirements, we'll need you to pick and complete _one_ of the following "delighter" fun features.
We do mean _one_: completing additional features will _not_ gain you points! Please only complete _one_.

- A: In addition to the "Next" button after taking a quiz, display the number of times the quiz has been taken along with a "Retake" button.
- B: In addition to the summary showing the number of questions correct after taking a quiz, display a list of the quiz's questions with the user's selected answer and whether it was correct beside each question.
- C: Add more tests!

See `./mockups/delighters/*.png` for rough descriptions of what A and B would look like.
